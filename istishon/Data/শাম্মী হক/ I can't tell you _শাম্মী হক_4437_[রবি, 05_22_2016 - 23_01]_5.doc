 I can't tell you 



I can tell you I am safe here
I can tell you nobody will kill me here
I can tell you about beautiful summer here
I can tell you about big hearted people here.
Please wait, listen to me. Please listen What I can't tell you:
I can't tell you, every night I grope you in dark
I can't tell you, every night I am searching your lap
I can't tell you, more and more thinks.
Oh my innocent beautiful mom, I am writing it in english only for you, Because I know you can't read english.
Because I can't tell you
Because I can't tell you.
