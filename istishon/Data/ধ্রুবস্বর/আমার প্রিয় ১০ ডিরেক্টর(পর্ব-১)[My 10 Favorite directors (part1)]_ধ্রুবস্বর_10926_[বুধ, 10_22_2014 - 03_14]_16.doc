Known in Bangladesh and the world for movies like - Juno, Up In The Air, Thank You for Smoking (film)
First seen by me- Thank You for Smoking
Jason Reitman, a very talented and energetic director. First time I saw his work was Thank you for smoking back in 2008. HBO was broadcasting it early in the morning. I got hooked up in the talk show scene. The link is given below watch it whenever you stop surfing for porn. Jason reitman handles the black humor elements beautifully throughout the film. Such a nicely crafted work of art in the film industry with this type script is rare. He follows the lead character a tobacco lobbyist played magnificently by aron eckhart throughout the film. Showing how karma gets right back at you. It also becomes true for female antagonist news reporter from washington probe played katie holmes.
Then two years passed. I forgot all about this film. Early in 2010 I was busy with my studies for HSC but still I watched the oscar presentation (Can't miss that) and came across this interesting preview from the oscars of "UP IN THE AIR". George clooney was dashing out there, Vera farmiga was as beautiful as ever. It looked very interesting. It got about 6 nominations. I was already hooked. Thanks to the #‎legend Jamil Hossain vai I had it within a few days.
What a movie it was. Excellent simply excellent. Incomparable experience. The premise, the way the drama plays out, the chemistry between the characters all were top notch.The performances were great. The movie sometimes moves into an isolated region with clooney because of the way his character is built but anna kendrik is there to set the momentum again. Vera farmiga does a dashing job playing a frustrated corporate woman who needs to take a break from her marriage life to spend time with clooney. As clooney and kendrick two very different personalities play the same role of career transitions agents the truth and despair of people believing in existentialism, isolation, Corporatization pops up frequently.
Again a 3 years from anything by Jason reitman I got my hands on JUNO. I guess this one is the most popular of his films. The film is morally murky than his other films. Its about a girl(played by Ellen page) who gets pregnant at the age of 16. She handles the pregnancy with the help of her family and put her baby to adaption to a divorcee woman (played by jennifer garner). Great pro-life,pro-choice and feminist film. But in some places it feels so unreal judging from my social context.I am calling it morally murky just because from my social context its not right to be pregnant at the age of 16. This film is responsible for the juno effect( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28film%29#.22The_Juno_Effect.22)
It just feels wrong to get bored and have sex and getting pregnant from the social backdrop I am from. Though a great and an enjoyable movie. Ellen page was excellent.
Famous film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars and called it "just about the best movie of the year. [...] Has there been a better performance this year than Ellen Page's creation of Juno? I don't think so."[Wikipedia] I agree totally on this.
Now let’s talk about Jason reitman only and what I think of him. The guy is fairly talented. He knows how to handle complex themes in a very light and fun way. The music,the locations, the cinematography everything contributes to make his movie downright enjoyable and easy to watch. The scripts he chose are excellent. They are fun and digestible. His works have a very beautiful and easy going environment that attracts you whenever you start watching them. He deals nicely with huge portion of black humor in the movies Thank you for smoking and JUNO
Mr. Reitman always gets great cast and brings the very best out of them. Aron eckhart from thank you for smoking, George clooney from Up in the air, Ellen page from Juno were all great. Clooney and Page earn the nomination for best actor & actress. Even the side actor & actresses provided great performances.Got oscar nominations too.
Mr.Reitman's movies remind me something I heard in the simpsons.
" Hollywood may be run by big corporations who want to squash people, but they make movies about people standing up to big corporations who want to squash them. and winning."
All his movies are spreading this same with a touch pro-life messages.Thank you for smoking,Up in the air both indicate the emptiness in the soulless void of the corporate world.
At last to be simple go watch his films they are fun and educative and will provide you with a strong ass kicking moral fiber, I guaranty you that
Happy watching
