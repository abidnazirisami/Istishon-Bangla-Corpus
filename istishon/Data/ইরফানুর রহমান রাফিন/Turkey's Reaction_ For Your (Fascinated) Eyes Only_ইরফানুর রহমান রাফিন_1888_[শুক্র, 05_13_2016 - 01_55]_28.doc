Turkey's Reaction_ For Your (Fascinated) Eyes Only


Some quick points on Turkey's reaction regarding the recent death penalty of war criminal Matiur Rahman Nizami:
1. I am no nationalist, I refuse to join the jingoist bandwagon against 'the Turkish nation' as a whole for a specific diplomatic crime of the AKP government. Mr. Erdogan is Nizami's brother in ideology. Justice and Development Party of Turkey, Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt and Syria, and Jamaat E Islami of Bangladesh share the same political belief.
2. I love Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet's poems. I love Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk's novels. Without any apology.
3. I'm sure you still remember little Aylan. Do you know who captured that heart-breaking photo which shocked the world conscience? A female Turkish photographer named Nilufer Demir!
4. The Turkey State is oppressing the Kurds? From the beginning? And they carried out genocide against Armenians? All historical facts, so, who will deny! I strongly believe that the Armenian genocide was a crime against humanity and I defend the Cause of my Kurd comrades from PKK. But, dear nationalists, what about keeping the Urdu-speaking Bihari community in inhuman living conditions and what about the murders and rapes carried out by Bangladesh State against the Pahari people of CHT? One should judge himself by the same standards with which he judges others.
5. A history lesson for my Awami buddies, specially for those with goldfish memories. Sheikh Hasina congratulated Ahmet Davutoglu on Justice and Development Party's victory in Turkey's general election last November. And if I believe Daily Sun's report, she was "delighted" to know the news of AKP's victory (http://www.daily-sun.com/post/87880/Dhaka-to-continue-cooperation-with-n...).
Though Erdogan and Hasina differs in ideology, they share a sultan-like psychology, holding Power at any means. Erdogan is running Turkey for 13 years, Hasina for 7 years, and in both Turkey and Bangladesh a Fascist regime has been established. So all this blame game is actually a carefully planned political strategy, to keep people-in both Turkey and Bangladesh-busy with their Past, so that they forget to think about their Present and (if there is any) Future.
